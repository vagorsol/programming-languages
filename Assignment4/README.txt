Programs Files:

How to Compile & Run:
====================
    - && kotlinc BabyNames.kt -include-runtime -d BabyNames.jar && java -jar BabyNames.jar
	
Reflection:
===========
    At first the assignment was very overwhemling as there was a lot of information given and it wasn't as organized/structured so I was overwhelmed, but it ended 
    up being not as bad as I feared. Nor as complex, although I struggled with the limitations and working with map/forEach. While I think I am starting to have a grasp
    on how to use them, I am far from totally understanding using them (and I didn't even use filter). There are definitely better ways - more data conservative, 
    less time consuming - to write this, and I think I should try and work out the "more efficient" way after I figure out the way that works based on how I approach the problem.
    Though, that's more work for (more or less virtually) the same result, which is probably why I didn't try and replace some of my functions that probably could have been (i.e. 
    addAlphabetically) since I'm not being graded for efficiency (yet).

I Worked With:
==============
    - Neha: Explained map to me
    - Bailey and Jospeh: Convincing me that trying to have a value that stored the percentage is a Bad Idea(tm) and it's much easier to write calculating it on the fly 
        (this is much more dramatic than how it actually went down)

Approximate Hours worked:
=========================
    9 hours

Special Instructions to the grader:
===================================
    N/A

Known Bugs or Limitations:
==========================
    - My percentages are off and I do not know why. The percentages do seem to be close to the given ones, though, so I am assuming difference in rounding or similar is going on here.

Other comments:
===============
    - I figured out how to format the "/** */" comments so that they collapse but it's not pretty and that makes me sad
    - I'm assuming prefix just refers to the begining part of the name, and nothing else (see: Dan -> Daniel O, Dan -> Aidan X)
